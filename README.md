# hello-world

Hello People & Others...

Just a Noob following the guides... been teaching myself to code using several available online tools.  Started with HTML and CSS... working on JS and trying to make a decision on whether to move onto Ruby on Rails or Python next.  Figured I could find some helpful humans here.
